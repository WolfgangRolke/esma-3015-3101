#Exercise 2: Probability and Simulation

###Problem 1

a. The routine **normal.ex(k)** generates data from different probability distributions. Decide for which k (from 1 to 10) the data comes from a normal distribution.

b. for those that do not come from a normal distribution, how large a sample size is needed so that the mean has a normal distribution? 

###Problem 2

Say a huge box contains 5000 red balls, 3000 blue balls and 1000 green balls. Write a simulation that finds the smallest number of balls we need to pick out of the box so that the probability we get at least one of each color is 90%.

###Problem 3

Say we flip a fair coin n times. Write a simulation that finds the smallest n so that the probability we get at least one of each heads  is 99%.

###Problem 4 

Say we roll a fair die in n times. Write a simulation that finds the smallest n so that the probability we get at least two sixes is 90%.

###Problem 5

Write a simulation that checks the empirical rule when generating data from

a. rnorm(50)  
b. rt(50,1) 

###Problem 6

A standard deck  as used to play Poker consists of 52 cards. Each card has a denomination (numbers 2 to 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace) and a suit (Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds and Spades. In many games a player first gets 5 cards (called a hand). Use simulation to find the probability that his hand is a

a. "Three of a kind" (3 cards of the same denomination)   
b. "Flush" (all 5 cards of the same suit)

##Solutions

###Problem 1
The routine **normal.ex(k)** generates data from different probability distributions. Decide for which k (from 1 to 10) the data comes from a normal distribution.

We will use the normal plot to check. So for the first case we can run

```{r}
nplot(normal.ex(1), main_title = "k = 1") 
```

Here are all the graphs:

```{r}
for(i in 2:10) nplot(normal.ex(i), main_title = paste("k =", i))
```

It seems k = 3, 6 and 9 have a normal distribution 

b. for those that do not come from a normal distribution, how large a sample size is needed so that the mean has a normal distribution? 

for this we keep generating data, add them to the vector and check whether the result has anormal distribution. For example

```{r}
xbar <- normal.ex(1)
for(i in 1:10) xbar <- xbar + normal.ex(1)
nplot(xbar/11) 
```

well not quite yet. Maybe 50?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1)
```
```{r}
xbar <- normal.ex(1)
for(i in 1:50) xbar <- xbar + normal.ex(1)
nplot(xbar/51) 
```

and that's not so bad.

For the others:

k=2: about 30  
k=4 about 10  
k=5 about 10  
k=7 about 10  
k=8 about 10  
k=10 never!  

###Problem 2 

Say a huge box contains 5000 red balls, 3000 blue balls and 1000 green balls. Write a simulation that finds the smallest number of balls we need to pick out of the box so that the probability we get at least one of each color is 90%.

say we want to find the probability of at least one ball of each color if we pick 10 balls:

```{r}
B <- 10000
y <- rep(0, B)
for(i in 1:B) {
 x <- sample( c("red", "blue", "green"), 
    size = 10, replace = TRUE, prob = c(5, 3, 1))
 if(sum(x == "red") == 0) y[i] <- 1
 if(sum(x == "blue") == 0) y[i] <- 1
 if(sum(x == "green") == 0) y[i] <- 1
}
sum(y)/B
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
p <- round(sum(y)/B, 3)
p1 <- 1-p
```

so the probability of at least one of each color is 1-`r p` = `r p1`, a little to small. Next let's try 20 balls:


```{r}
B <- 10000
y <- rep(0,B)
for(i in 1:B) {
 x <- sample( c("red", "blue", "green"), size = 20, 
    replace = TRUE, prob=c(5, 3, 1))
 if(sum(x == "red") == 0) y[i] <- 1
 if(sum(x == "blue") == 0) y[i] <- 1
 if(sum(x == "green") == 0) y[i] <- 1
}
sum(y)/B
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
p <- round(sum(y)/B, 3)
p1 <- 1-p
```

and now the probability of at least one of each color is 1-`r p` = `r p1`, almost there.

Would 19 have been enough? Let's see:

```{r}
B <- 10000
y <- rep(0,B)
for(i in 1:B) {
 x <- sample( c("red", "blue", "green"), size = 19, 
    replace = TRUE, prob=c(5, 3, 1))
 if(sum(x == "red") == 0) y[i] <- 1
 if(sum(x == "blue") == 0) y[i] <- 1
 if(sum(x == "green") == 0) y[i] <- 1
}
1 - sum(y)/B
```

and the answer is no!

`r rmd$hr()`

###Problem 3

Say we flip a fair coin n times. Write a simulation that finds the smallest n so that the probability we get at least one of each heads is 99%.

let's try 10 heads:

```{r}
B <- 10000
y <- rep(0,B)
for(i in 1:B) {
 x <- sample(0:1, size = 10, replace = TRUE)
 if(sum(x) == 0) y[i] <- 1
}
1 - sum(y)/B
```

a bit to large. Now trying different n's we find

n = 9: 0.9980  
n = 8: 0.9961  
n = 7: 0.9922  
n = 6: 0.9844 

so n = 7 is just large enough. 

`r rmd$hr()`

###Problem 4 

Say we roll a fair die in n times. Write a simulation that finds the smallest n so that the probability we get at least two sixes is 90%.

the probability of a six is 1/6, so the probability of two sixes is 1/6*1/6 = 1/36, so we would expect two or more sixes every 36 rolls or so. Let's try that:

```{r}
B <- 10000
y <- rep(0, B)
for(i in 1:B) {
 x <- sample(0:1, size = 36, replace = TRUE, 
    prob = c(5,1)/6)
 if(sum(x) > 1) y[i] <- 1
}
sum(y)/B
```

a bit to large, so let's try some smaller n's:

-  n=30: p=0.97
-  n=25: p=0.94  
-  n=20: p=0.87  
-  n=22: p=0.9
-  n=21: p=0.89 
and so we find n=22! 

`r rmd$hr()`

###Problem 5 

Write a simulation that checks the empirical rule when generating data from

a. rnorm(1000) 

```{r}
B <- 10000
y <- rep(0, B)
for(i in 1:B) {
   x <- rnorm(1000)
   low <- mean(x) - 2*sd(x)
   high <- mean(x) + 2*sd(x)
   z <- x[x > low]
   z <- z[z < high]
   y[i] <- length(z)
}
mean(y)
```
```{r, include=FALSE}
ny <- round(mean(y), 1)
```

the interval should include 95% of the data, 95% of 1000 is 950, it includes `r ny`, so that's good.

b. rt(1000, 1)

```{r}
B <- 10000
y <- rep(0, B)
for(i in 1:B) {
   x <- rt(1000, 1)
   low <- mean(x) - 2*sd(x)
   high <- mean(x) + 2*sd(x)
   z <- x[x > low]
   z <- z[z < high]
   y[i] <- length(z)
}
mean(y)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
ny <- round(mean(y), 1)
```

the interval should include 95% of the data, 95% of 1000 is 950, it includes `r ny`, so that's not good

###Problem 6

A standard deck as used to play Poker consists of 52 cards. Each card has a denomination (numbers 2 to 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace) and a suit (Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds and Spades. In many games a player first gets 5 cards (called a hand). Use simulation to find the probability that his hand is a 

a. "Three of a kind" (3 cards of the same denomination)  
b. "Flush" (all 5 cards of the same suit)  

Let's denote the denominations by numbers 1-13. Each of them appears 4 times in the deck, so we can use 

```{r}
den <- rep(1:13, 4)
```

We draw 5 cards without repitition, so we can do that with 

```{r}
x <- sample(den,5)
```

In a "Three of a kind" we then need 3 equal numbers, for example (1, 5, 5, 5, 7) or (4, 6, 10, 10, 10). We can use the table command to get how many of each we have

```{r}
tbl.x <- table(x)
tbl.x
```

Now if there is a three, it must be the largest number (because there are only 5 cards), so we can check with

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if(max(tbl.x) == 3)
```
and we can do all of it in one step
```{r}
if(max(table(sample(rep(1:13, 4), 5))) == 3) 
   y[i] <- 1 
```

How about the "Flush"? Now we are interested in the denominations so we pick them with sample(rep(1:4, 13), 5). In a "Flush" all of them are the same number, for example (3, 3, 3, 3, 3) and we can check this with if(length(table()) == 1). With this we have

```{r}
if(length(table(sample(rep(1:4, 13), 5))) == 1) 
   y[i] <- 1 
```

Now:

```{r}
B <- 10000
y <- rep(0,B)
y1 <- rep(0, B)
for(i in 1:B) {
   if(max(table(sample(rep(1:13, 4), 5))) == 3) 
      y[i] <- 1 
   if(length(table(sample(rep(1:4, 13), 5))) == 1) 
      y1[i] <- 1 
}
sum(y)/B
sum(y1)/B
```
