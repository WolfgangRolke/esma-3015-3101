#Exercise 4:  Correlation and Regression

###Problem 1:
Consider round 1 and and 2 of the Sony open golf tournament (data set **golfscores**). Is there a statistically significant relationship between the scores?

###Problem 2:
Consider round 1 and and 2 of the Sony open golf tournament (data set **golfscores**). What is the least squares regression equation with Sony 1 as the predictor variable? Draw the fitted line plot. Is there an indication of "regression to the mean"? Why?

###Problem 3:
Consider the men's long jump in the Olympics (**longjump**). How strong is the relationship between Year and LongJump? 

###Problem 4:
Consider the following data set:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x <- c(10 ,	11 ,	12 ,	13 ,	14 ,	15 ,	16 ,	17 ,	18 ,	19,	20 )
y <- c(58, 	54, 	51, 	52, 	62, 	57, 	63, 	64, 	69, 	71 ,	70 )
p4data <- data.frame(x=x, y=y)
kable(p4data)
```

Find the least squares regression equation and use it to predict the y value for an observation with x=15

##Solutions

###Problem 1:
Consider round 1 and and 2 of the Sony open golf tournament (data set **golfscores**). Is there a statistically significant relationship between the scores?

Parameter: correlation coeffcient

Problem Test for independence

Method: pearson.test

```{r}
attach(golfscores) 
```

1) Parameter: Pearson's correlation coefficient $\rho$
2) Method: Test for Pearson's correlation coefficient $\rho$
3) Assumptions: relationship is linear and that there are no outliers.
4) $\alpha = 0.05$   
5) H~0~: $\rho =0$ (no relationship between Day of Year and Draft Number) 
6) H~a~: $\rho \ne 0$ (some relationship between Day of Year and Draft Number) 
7) p = 0.000 

```{r}
pearson.cor(Sony1, Sony2, rhoNull=0)
```

8) $p<\alpha = 0.05$, so we reject the null hypothesis,
9) There is a statistically significant relationship between Day of Year and Draft Number.  

Assumptions: boxplots and scatterplot show no outliers. No non-linear relationship. 

###Problem 2:
Consider round 1 and and 2 of the Sony open golf tournament (data set **golfscores**). What is the least squares regression equation with Sony 1 as the predictor variable? Draw the fitted line plot. Is there an indication of "regression to the mean"? Why?

Parameter: regression coefficients 

Problem: find model 

Method: slr 

```{r}
slr(Sony2, Sony1)
```

```{r}
splot(y=Sony2, x=Sony1, addLine=1)
```

the slope of the line (0.348) is between 0 and 1, so yes, there is an indication of regression to the mean. 

###Problem 3:
Consider the men's long jump in the Olympics (**longjump**). How strong is the relationship between Year and LongJump? 

Parameter: correlation coeffcient

Problem: find correlation 

Method: ????

the scatterplot of LongJump by Year shows a non-linear relationship, so we can't answer this question (want to know? come to ESMA3102!) 
```{r}
attach(longjump)
splot(LongJump, Year)
```

###Problem 4:
Consider the following data set:

```{r}
kable(p4data)
```

Find the least squares regression equation and use it to predict the y value for an observation with x=15

Parameter: regression coefficients 

Problem: find model 

Method: slr 

```{r}
slr(y=y, x=x)
```

```{r}
32.773 + 1.882*15
```

so y=61 is the prediction.
