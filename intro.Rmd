# Introduction 

This page discusses some general concepts of Statistics.

##Motivation for learning Statistics

Quote: 

*If I had only one hour to live, I would choose to live it in statistics class because it would seem to last forever*

(A student's complaint)  

Why does Statistics appear to be so boring?

Consider the following questions:

- Does aspirin lower the risk of heart attacks?  (Medical research)  
- Are there fewer Manatees in Puerto Rico today than 10 years ago? (Biology)  
- Does a certain brand of gasoline really clean the engine? (Chemistry and Mechanical Engineering)  
- Do tax cuts work? (Economics and Government Policy)  
- Does anger management training work? (Psychology and Law)  
- Do frequent flier programs increase airline ticket sales? (Business)  
- Do the salaries of men and women differ? (Social Sciences and Law) 
Amazingly enough, a person investigating any of these questions might well end up using the same statistical method to answer them! (It is called the one-sample t test and we will study it at some time during this semester)
The power, strength (and beauty) of statistics lies in its universal applicability!

##What is Statistics?

Answer 1: Statistics is the Science of **data** (or information)

- How to collect data
- How to analyze data
- How to present data

Answer 2: Statistics is the Science of **Uncertainty**

- where does it come from
- what types are there
- how to deal with it
 
##Why everybody should know a little bit about Statistics - Misuse of Statistics

Statistics can be used in many ways to make things appear to be something that it is not (lying!)

Another quote:

*There are Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics* 

(maybe Benjamin Disraeli, probably not)

##What can we do with Statistics?

###Case Study: WRInc 

WR Inc. is a large (ficticous) company. It recently did a survey of all its employees, asking them to fill out a questionnaire with questions regarding their gender, income etc.   
In addition they randomly selected 500 employees and asked them some additional questions. 

Let's start by checking what's in the data set:

```{r}
head(wrinccensus)   
```

shows us the names of the variables and the first six rows of data. 

**Note**: when something appears in a box like this it means you can type (or copy-paste) this into R and get the same answer.
  
```{r}
dim(wrinccensus) 
```

shows us that  there are 23791 **observations**, one for each employee, and with 6 pieces of information (variables) for a total of 23791*6 = 142746. 

Trying to look at so much information is very difficult, so organizing it in some fashion is very useful. 

Often just making a little table is a good idea:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
attach(wrinccensus) 
table(Gender) 
```

Sometimes it is better to consider percentages:

```{r}
length(Gender)
table(Gender)/length(Gender)*100
round(table(Gender)/length(Gender)*100, 2) 
```

or maybe even both: 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
out <- data.frame(table(Gender),
  Percentage=paste0(round(table(Gender)/length(Gender)*100, 2),"%"))
colnames(out)[2] <- "N"
kable(out)
```

Another good way to study a dataset is via **graphs**. For example, it seems reasonable that there should be a connection between job level and income, after all usually people with a better job make more money. Is this true for our company? For this we can use 

```{r}
splot(Income, Job.Level)
```

As we will see soon, often we have different ways to do the same thing in Statistics.   For example, instead of the scatterplot above we could draw something called a boxplot, which we will discuss at some point in this class. And in fact, this would be a very good idea because there is a serious problem with the scatterplot. Can you see what it is? 

`r rmd$vs()`

An important question would be whether there is **job discrimination** in this company, that is whether men are paid more than women. How can we find out? Let's compute the average income of the men and the average income of the women. But before we do we need to understand that 
 
- the two will **not be the exactly the same**!  
- so one will be higher than the other, just by random chance. 

In fact even if there is no job discrimination there is a 50-50 chance that the average income of the men is (a little bit) higher than the average income of the women. Of course if there is job discrimination we would expect the average income of the men to be substantially higher than the average income of the women. What we need to find out is whether the men's income is `r rmd$fontcolor("statistically significantly higher")`!
 
Something is statistically significant if it cannot be expained by `r rmd$fontcolor("random chance")` alone.

**Example** 4 heads in 4 flips of a fair coin has a probability of 1 in 16 or 6.25%, so this would not be considered unusual

**Example** 10 heads in 10 flips of a fair coin has a probability of 1 in 1028 or 0.01%, so this would be considered very unusual. In fact one would now conclude that this coin is not a fair coin. 

**Note** What is and what is not statistically significant is a question of `r rmd$fontcolor("probability")`.

back to WRInc:

```{r}
stat.table(Income , Gender)
```

We find that the average income is
  
```{r, echo=FALSE}
options(scipen=999)
mf <- round(tapply(Income, Gender, mean), 1)
```
  
Female: $\$`r mf[1]`$  
Male: $\$`r mf[2]`$
  
so the difference is $`r mf[2]` -`r mf[1]` = \$`r mf[2] - mf[1]`$. 

- Is this a "substantial" or a "little" difference?  
- Is this a "statistically significant" difference?  
- Does it "prove" discrimination?  

"prove" here has just about the same meaning as it does in a criminal trial: beyond any reasonable doubt. 

To answer the question we would need to do a `r rmd$fontcolor("hypothesis test")`.
`r rmd$vs()`

One way to answer that question is to use a method discussesd in ESMA 3102 called the two-sample t test. You might be surprised to learn that indeed the difference is to large to be due to random chance! 

Careful, though: although the difference is statistically significant, it still does not mean that there is discrimination, because the difference in salaries might be caused by other factors such as the fact that there are more men at the higher job levels, that men tend to have more years at the company etc. This is an example of one of the major issues in Statistics:

`r rmd$fontcolor("Correlation does not imply Causation ")` 
or here: there is some connection between gender and income (specifically men are paid more than women) but it is not clear yet why that is. One possible reason is discrimination, but there could be others.

##Some Basic Terminology of Statistics

**`r rmd$fontcolor("Population")` **: all of the entities (people, events, things etc.) that are the focus of a study
  
**Example 1** Say we are interested in the average age of the undergraduate students at the Colegio. 
  
**Example 2 ** A company is considering to sell a new product in Puerto Rico, but before they do they want to know how many people in Puerto Rico might be interested in buying it.
  
**Example 3 ** All possible hurricanes, past and **future**. 
Clearly this last one is  much more complicated population than the undergraduate students at the Colegio. In order to properly describe it we will need **probability**. 

**`r rmd$fontcolor("Census")` **: If all the entities of a population are included in the study.

**Example 1** if we ask the Registrars Office they might give as the ages of all these students, and if we then ask all the students how old they are we we would have done a census.

**Example 2 ** impossible for practical reasons (we cannot ask every person in Puerto Rico ) 

**Example 3** impossible for theoretical reasons (future?)
**`r rmd$fontcolor("Sample")` **: any subset of the population

**Example 1** let's take the students in the room as a sample.

**Example 2** ask all our friends and relatives

**Example 3 ** all the hurricanes during the last 10 years. 
**`r rmd$fontcolor("Random sample")` **: a sample found through some randomization (flip of a coin, random numbers on computer etc.)

**Example 1**: Are you a random sample?

**Example 2** do a telephone survey

**Example 3 ** yes

**`r rmd$fontcolor("Simple Random Sample (SRS)")` **: each "entity" in the population has an equal chance of being chosen for the sample. 

**Example 1**  Are you a simple random sample?

**Example 2 ** depends on exactly how the telephone numbers are chose, but generally ok 

**Example 3 ** all the hurricanes during the last 10 years: yes

**`r rmd$fontcolor("Data")` **:  the collection of many pieces of information
  
**Example 1** a table with the ages of the students in our sample
  
**Example 2** list of answers (yes - I would buy the product, no - I would not) 

**Example 3 ** all the data available about a hurricane: track, windspeed, air pressure etc.

**`r rmd$fontcolor("Parameter")` **: any numerical quantity 
associated with a population

**Example 1** If we had the ages of **all** 10000 or so undergraduate students we could calculate the average, and it would be a parameter

**Example 2 ** the percentage of all the people in PR who would buy the product - impossible to find exactly because we cannot do a census. 

**Example 3 ** the average top windspeed of the strongest hurricane in any one year. This is a number that nobody knows or can know, even theoretically. 

**Example 4 ** The mean income of the employees of WRInc. Because we have the income data for **all** the employees this is a parameter.

**`r rmd$fontcolor("Statistic")` **: any numerical quantity associated with a sample

**Example 1** let's calculate **your** average age. You are a sample, so this is a statistic.

**Example 2** the percentage of people in our sample who say they would buy the product 

**Example 3** Take the last 10 years as a sample, and calculate the average of the top windspeeds of the strongest hurricane in each year. 

**Example 4 ** The mean IQ of the employees of WRInc. Because we have the IQ data for only 500 of the employees this is a statistic.
Note there is **one** value of the population parameter (at a fixed moment in time) but there are many different values of the statistic, depending on the sample that was selected.

**`r rmd$fontcolor("Statistical Error")` ** the uncertainty in the value of the statistic due to the fact we only used a sample. 

**Example 1** If the average age of the students in the classroom is 21.25, what does this tell us about the average age of **all** the undergraduate students? Is it possible that this might be much higher, maybe even over 22 years? 

**Example 2** If 30% of the people in the sample say they would buy the product, what might be the number for the whole island?

**Example 3 **If the strongest hurricane in the last 10 years had indspeeds up to 130 miles per hour, does this mean we will not have one with 150 miles per hour this year? 

**`r rmd$fontcolor("Bias")` ** Any systematic difference between the population and the sample with respect to a variable.

**Example 1** Are you (the class) a biased sample?

**Example 2** depends on how the selection of telephone numbers is done.

**Example 3 ** Are the last 10 years a biased sample?
Avoiding bias is the main reason for using a Simple Random Sample.

##Categorical vs. Quantitative Variables

**Example** Let's consider again **WRInc**

a) Variable Gender: most obvious thing to do: count how many males and females are in the company

b) Variable Income: find average income of employees.

Why the difference?  

In real live we always use a computer for all the calculations. That leaves two tasks for the human being doing Statistics:

Decide

- what is the best method for analysing a specific dataset?

- what is the result of the analysis telling you about the 
experiment?

Most important here are

- **the computer will not do these steps for you**

- (Almost always) the computer will do the analysis you ask it to do, even if this analysis is **complete nonsense**
 
In order to know what method to use it is important to understand some basic features of your data. One is its **data type**:

We categorize variables as follows:

A.  **`r rmd$fontcolor("Quantitative")` **
data is numeric, and arithmetic makes sense (adding, multiplying etc.) 

**Example** 

1) Yearly income of a family in Puerto Rico 

2) Temperature in Mayaguez at 12 Noon 

3) Amount paid for the phone bill 

B.  **`r rmd$fontcolor("Categorical")` **

everything else

**Example**

1) A students major

2) in an experiment to grow wheat three different fertilizers were labeled 1,2 and 3 

3)  Your student id number

**Note** Often whether a variable is categorical or quantitative depends on how (and how precisely) it is measured.

**Example** Our variable is "amount of rain fall"

- Is it raining at all? "Yes" or "No" &rarr; categorical

- We put a cup outside. The cup has marks for each cubic inch of rain. Our data is the number of cubic inches. Values will be 0, 1, maybe 2.  &rarr; quantitative

Categorical data comes in one of two versions - **ordered or unordered**: 

**Examples**

1. grades in a course: A, B, C, D, W - ordered

2. gender: Male, Female - unordered

3. Treatments in a clinical trial: A, B, C - unordered 

4. Treatments in a clinical trial: 1, 2, 3 - unordered 

5. blood pressure: low medium high - ordered 

6. directions: north east south west - unordered

One consequence of having an ordering is that it should be used in graphs, tables etc.

###Case Study: WRInc

Let's look at the variables in the survey of **wrinccensus**

```{r}
head(wrinccensus)
```
