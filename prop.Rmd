#Inference for a Proportion (Percentage) $\pi$

[Assumptions](#a1)  
[Confidence Interval](#a2)  
[Hypothesis Test](#a3)  
[Power](#a4)</TD>  
[Sample Size](#a5) 

In this section we will discuss inference for proportions (or percentages) such as the percentage of people who prefer Coke over Pepsi, who will vote PNP in the next election, who earn more than $50,000 per year etc.

Say we do a survey of n people and ask them "Do you prefer Coke over Pepsi?" Then if we only allow "Yes"and "No" answers we have the Bernoulli trial with success probability $\pi$. The object of interest here is $\pi$, the proportion of people in the whole population who prefer Coke over Pepsi. Obviously the proportion in the sample who prefer Coke over Pepsi will be our point estimate of $\pi$. 

Notation: often in this context we use  $\widehat{p}$

**Example** Say in a survey of 500 people 312 say they prefer Coke over Pepsi. Then a point estimate for the proportion of people who prefer Coke over Pepsi is

$$
\widehat{p} = \frac{312}{500} = 0.624
$$

`r rmd$hr()`

**Note** Most often problems are stated in terms of **percentages** instead of **proportions** but all the methods use proportions. Simply multiply by 100% at the end.

**Example** A point estimate for the percentage of people who prefer Coke over Pepsi is $62.4\%$

**Note** Sometimes problems are for **probabilites**, that is the same as proportion in this context. 

**Example** The probability of a six on a fair die is 16% 

##Method

Exact Binomial

##Assumptions {#a1}

`r rmd$fontcolor("None!")`

##Confidence Interval {#a2}
A $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval for the population proportion $\pi$ is found with the **one.sample.prop** command. 

###Case Study: Binge Drinking in College 

Alcohol on college campuses is a very serious problem. But how common is it? A survey of 17,096 students in US four-year colleges collected information on drinking behavior and alcohol-related problems.
(Henry Wechsler et al., "Health and Behavioral Consequences of Binge 

Drinking in College", *Journal of the American Medical Association*, 272 (1994). 

The researchers defined "frequent binge drinking" as having five or more drinks in a row three or more times in the past two weeks.    According to this definition 3,314 students were classified as frequent binge drinkers.

**Problem:** Find a point estimate for the percentage of frequent binge drinkers.

Solution: A point estimate for the proportion of frequent binge drinkers is

$$
\widehat{p} = \frac{3314}{17096} = 0.194
$$

therefore a point estimate for the percentage is 19.4%

**Problem:** Find a 99% confidence interval for the percentage of frequent binge drinkers.

```{r}
one.sample.prop(x = 3314, n = 17096, conf.level = 99) 
```

**Note** unlike the *one.sample.t* command the *one.sample.prop* command has no argument *shat*. 

###Case Study: Vacations of Puerto Ricans 

The website of the [Puerto Rico Tourism Company](href="http://www.prtourism.com/") has the results of a survey of Puerto Ricans and their vacation travel. The study measures short trip leisure travel habits of average Puerto Rican families and allows for the monitoring of consumer preferences on a continuous basis. According to the report for July - September 2009 10% of the respondents had made a trip to Cabo Rojo, the highest number of any place in PR. 

Find a 95% CI for the true percentage of PR travelers who visit Cabo Rojo. The survey was based on 400 interviews.

```{r}
one.sample.prop(x = 40, n = 400, conf.level = 95) 
```

**Example** In a sample of 200 people entering a store, 61 actually bought something. Find a 90% confidence interval for the percentage of "buyers".

```{r}
one.sample.prop(x = 61, n = 200, conf.level = 90) 
```

##Hypothesis Test {#a3}

Null Hypothesis: $H_0: \pi = \pi_0$ 

Alternative Hypothesis: Choose `r rmd$fontcolor("one")` of the following:

a. $H_a: \pi < \pi_0$  
b. $H_a: \pi > \pi_0$ 
c. $H_a: \pi \ne \pi_0$  

Again we can use the one.sample.prop command. To get the p value of a test we need to use the argument piNull 

###Case Study: Jon Kerrichs Coin 

Test at the 5% level of significance whether 5067 heads in 10000 flips are compatible with a fair coin. 

1. Parameter: proportion $\pi$   
2. Method: exact binomial   
3. Assumptions: None   
4. $\alpha = 0.05$   
5. $H_0: \pi = 0.5$ (50% of flips result in "Heads", coin is fair)   
6. $H_a: \pi \ne 0.5$ (coin is not fair)   
7. $p = 0.1835$

```{r}
one.sample.prop(x = 5067, n = 10000, piNull = 0.5) 
```
  
8. $p = 0.1835 > \alpha=0.05$, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis.  
9. it appears Jon Kerrich's coin was indead fair.

**Example** Let's assume for a moment that Jon Kerrichs coin was actually **not** a fair coin but one with $\pi = 0.505$. How often would he have had to flip his coin to reject the null hypothesis?

Of course now we don't have any data, so we have to guess what $\widehat{\pi}$ might have been. For example if he had flipped this coin 10000 times we would expect him to get about $10000\times 0.505 = 5050$ heads. Running the test with these numbers we find: 

```{r} 
n <- 10000
one.sample.prop(x = 0.505*n, n = n, piNull = 0.5)
```

```{r}
n <- 20000
one.sample.prop(x = 0.505*n, n = n, piNull = 0.5)
```

```{r}
n <- 30000
one.sample.prop(x = 0.505*n, n = n, piNull = 0.5)
```

```{r}
n <- 40000
one.sample.prop(x = 0.505*n, n = n, piNull = 0.5)
```

so if he had flipped his coin about 40000 times he would have rejected the null hypothesis of a fair coin at the 5% level.

**Remember**: even small differences (0.5 vs 0.505) will be rejected if the sample size is large enough 

###Practice Example 

Say we roll a  die 500 times and got 100 "sixes". Is this compatible with a fair die? Test at the 5% level.

1. Parameter: proportion $\pi$  
2. Method: exact binomial  
3. Assumptions: None  
4. $\alpha = 0.05$  
5. $H_0: \pi = 1/6$ (die is fair)  
6. $H_a: \pi \ne 1/6$ (die is not fair)  
7. $p = 0.0524$  

```{r, eval=2, echo=1}
one.sample.prop(x = 100, n = 500, piNull = 1/6) 
one.sample.prop(x = 100, n = 500, piNull = 0.167) 
```

8. $p = 0.0524 > \alpha=0.05$, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis.  
9. it appears this is a fair die 

##Power of the Test {#a4}

Again we need to worry about the power of our test. 

###Case Study: Jon Kerrichs Coin 

let's assume his coin had a probability of 0.505 to come up heads.
What was the power of the test we did above? To find out we can use the *prop.ps* command:

```{r}
prop.ps(n = 10000, phat = 0.505, piNull = 0.5)
```

so with "just" 10000 flips there was only a very small chance of detecting that his coin was a little unfair. 

Again one would probably do this for many values of $\pi$ and draw a graph.

**Note** unlike in the *t.ps* command in the *prop.ps* command we need need both phat and piNull, not just the difference:

```{r fig.show='hide'}
prop.ps(n = 10000, phat = 0.5, piNull = 0.505)
```


##Sample Size Calculation {#a5}

As with the mean the sample size calculation is different depending on whether we want to do a hypothesis test or find a confidence interval

###Case Study: Jon Kerrichs Coin 

If indeed his coin had a probability of Heads of 0.505, how often would he have to flip his coin to have a power of 90%?

```{r}
prop.ps(power = 90, phat = 0.505, piNull = 0.5)
```

How about if we want to find a confidence interval? As with the mean we have to decide on the error E (twice the length of the interval) we want. Then we can use the prop.ps command.

We have the same problem as with the mean here, the sample size depends on the true $\pi$, but we are trying to estimate $\pi$!

The same ideas as with the mean such as doing a pilot study work here as well. In addition we have something else we can do here. It turns out that using phat = 1/2 will lead to a sample size that is always sufficient. prop.ps does this unless another phat is given. 

**Example** You want to do a survey of likely voters for the next election. You want to find a 95% confidence interval for the percentage of voters for the PNP, with an arror of E = 0.03. What sample size is required?

```{r}
prop.ps(E = 0.03)
```

**Example** same as above, but for the PIP. Here we already know that $\pi$ is around 5%, so

```{r}
prop.ps(phat = 0.05, E = 0.03)
```

Look again at the prop.ps command for the sample size. There is something truely amazing about what is **not** part of command!

**Example **

We want to do a study on the percentage of students in some class that are female. We want to find a 95% confidence interval with an error of 2%. What sample size will we need?

```{r}
prop.ps(E = 0.02)
```

**Example** A company regularly receives a shipment of electronic parts. Their contract with the supplier says that the shipment can contain up to 5% faulty parts. They suspect that the current shipment has 10% faulty parts. If they plan on randomly selecting parts, testing them and then do a hypothesis test at the 10% level, how many parts do they need to select so that the hypothesis test has a power of 90%? 

```{r}
prop.ps(power = 90, phat = 0.1, piNull = 0.05, 
    alpha = 0.1, alternative = "greater")
```
