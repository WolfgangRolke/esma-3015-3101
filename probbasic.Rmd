#Why Probability?

###Case Study: Is this Coin Fair?

Let's say you have a specific coin and you want to see whether it is actually a **fair**  coin, or whether it comes up heads more than tails. So you sit down and flip the coin 1000 times and get $N$ heads. 

What do you think $N$ should be for this to NOT be a fair coin?
Because (for some reason) we only care about the case were we get more heads than tails obviously we need $N>500$ before we would conclude that this is an unfair coin. But also quite clearly (say) $N=510$ would not be convincing enough to say this is an unfair coin. 

But why not? 

Simply because a fair coin can easily give $510$ heads in $1000$ flips, or the probability of $510$ heads in $1000$ flips of a **fair*** coin is not so small.

Actually it is very small ($0.0207$) but there are many possible outcomes, and so the probability of any one of them has to be small, for example 500 heads in 1000 flips has a probability of 0.0252, even though it is the most likely outcome. And relative to 0.0252 0.0207 is large. 

Because of this what we will calculate is the probability of **N or more heads** in 1000 flips of a fair coin. Now we find

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x <- seq(500, 550, 5)
p <- round(1-pbinom(x-1, 1000, 0.5), 3)
out <- data.frame(x, Probability=p)
colnames(out)[1] <- "N or more"
kable(out)
```

and so somewhere around N=530 these probabilities get very small, it is then more reasonable to think that the coin is actually not fair. 

The topics we have discussed so far in this class (making graphs, computing things like the mean or the median) go under the heading of **descriptive statistics**.  What we want to do now is make a guess what the true "state of nature" is based on the available information, namely decide whether this is a fair coin or not. This type of problem goes under the heading of **inferential statistics**. As we just saw, this generally means calculating some probabilities.

By the way eventually we will call the probabilities in the table **p-values**.  

##Statistically Significant

In Statistics you often hear statements like: 

**"The new drug is statistically significantly better than the old one"**

What does this mean? 

The statement **"The new drug is statistically significantly better than the old one"** means that an experiment was carried out, and the new drug  performed better than the old one. More than that, if the same experiment were repeated again (with different subjects) we expect the new drug to perform better again **with a high probability** (90%? 99%?)

##Probability  Distributions

A **Probability Distribution ** is a model for a real live experiment

**Example** We roll a fair die:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x <- 1:6
p <- rep("1/6", 6)
out <- data.frame(x=x, Probability=p)
kable(out)
```

**Example** We roll a fair die until the first six appears. How many rolls are needed? 

P(six on first roll) = 1/6

P(first six on second roll) = P(no six on first roll, a six on second roll) = $5/6\times 1/6$

P(first six on third roll) = P(no six on first two rolls, a six on third roll) =  $5/6 \times 5/6 \times 1/6$

It's easy to guess the general case:

P(first six on k^th^ roll) = $(5/6)^{k-1} 1/6$, k=1,2,..

So for example

P(first six on the 5^th^ roll) = P(X=5) = $(5/6)^{5-1} 1/6$ = 0.0804

###App
To illustrate this experiment run the app

```{r eval=FALSE}
run.app(geometric)
```


`r rmd$hr()`

Probability distributions describe populations. The distribution in the first example tells us everything we might want to know about the population of all possible outcomes of the experiment "roll a fair die". There are formulas for all sorts of things. For example, say we roll the die a million times and keep track of the rolls. Then we find the mean. What would it be? Theory tells us it is 3.5. How about the standard deviation? it would be 1.7. How do we know this? Because we can do some math and calculated them from the distribution.

There is a fairly small list of "basic" distributions that cover a wide variety of everyday experiments and random phenomena. Here is one: 

The most basic experiment possible is one that has only two possible outcomes:

- flip a coin - heads or tails
- roll a  die -  get a six or don't
- take a class - pass or fail
- person smokes - yes or no
- person has open heart surgery - person survives or dies

any such experiment is called a **Bernoulli trial**, named after the Swiss mathematician Jakob Bernoulli (1655-1705)

![](graphs/bernoulli.gif)

**Note** often one of the two outcomes is called a "success" and the other one a "failure". But for the calculations it makes no difference what is what. This sometimes leads to a bit of nastiness: 
 
- person has open heart surgery - person survives (=failure) or dies (=success) 

Usualy we "code" one outcome as 0 (=failure) and the other as 1 (=success) . Then the distribution is given by

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x <- 0:1
p <- c("1-p", "p")
out <- data.frame(x=x, Probability=p)
colnames(out)[2] <- "P(x)"
kable(out)
```

Note that this does not describe the experiment completely but only up to the p. This lets us "tailor" the distribution to specific experiments: 

**Example**: Flip a fair coin, Heads = success = 1: p = 0.5

**Example**: Roll a fair die,  "get a six" =  success = 1: p=1/6

**Example**: Choose employee from WRInc, employee is female = success = 1, p=9510/23791=0.3997 

**Example** choose people from some population, person has a genetic condition = success = 1: p=0.015

The number p then is a number that belongs to the population described by the distribution: it is a **parameter**! 

Once we have a distribution we can find formulas for the **population** mean and standard deviation. For the Bernoulli distribution we have 

-  **Population Mean**: $\mu =p$
  
-  **Population Standard Deviation**: $\sigma = \sqrt{p(1-p)}$
